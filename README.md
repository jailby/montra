# montra

## Idea

Montra for monitoring trading.
Some people may be trading on different platforms and could consolidate all stock in one place.
Current solution don't allow to do much? Automatic info such as capital gain total/this day etc.
Modulability to have the thing that speak the most to the user. Graph timeline, axis. Pie charts etc.


I would like an easy to monitor stock for common people.

- Signin and authentication would be through a third party to not have to handle this mess (email signin, aka no pwd database)
- Main page could be **Watchlist**, **Sign in**, and **News**.
- Personal page could be **overall portofolio details**, **Stock list**, **Watchlist**, and **News**
- When clicking a stock it would bring graph/piechart, bought at and when (per unit and total), current value (unit and total), etc.


# Expansion 

- Alerts could be something simple enough to add
